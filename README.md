## What is this thing?

Great question! We're still figuring that out ourselves. 

ProjectName™ is a revolutionary, paradigm-shifting, blockchain-adjacent, AI-powered, cloud-native solution that solves problems you didn't know you had in ways you never asked for. It's like a Swiss Army knife, if Swiss Army knives were written in JavaScript and had 47 dependencies for parsing dates.

## Features

- ✅ **Works on my machine** - The gold standard of software quality
- ✅ **Enterprise-ready** - Has at least one `try/catch` block
- ✅ **Scalable** - Crashes consistently across all environments
- ✅ **Secure** - Password is not "password123" (it's "Password123!")
- ✅ **Fast** - Faster than rewriting it from scratch (barely)
- ✅ **Responsive** - Will definitely respond to your GitHub issues (with confusion)

## Installation

```bash
# The easy way (doesn't work)
npm install projectname

# The hard way (also doesn't work, but with style)
git clone https://github.com/yourname/projectname.git
cd projectname
npm install
npm run pray-to-the-demo-gods
```

### System Requirements

- Node.js (any version from 12.x to 18.x, but not 13.x, 15.x, or 17.x because reasons)
- At least 47GB of RAM (for the node_modules folder)
- Low expectations
- Coffee (mandatory)

## Quick Start

```javascript
const ProjectName = require('projectname');

// This will either work perfectly or set your computer on fire
const result = ProjectName.doSomething();
console.log(result); // "undefined" - as expected
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available in the `docs/` folder, which contains:
- `todo.md` - A comprehensive list of documentation we plan to write
- `notes.txt` - Random thoughts from 3am coding sessions
- `how_does_this_even_work.docx` - Exactly what it sounds like

For more detailed documentation, please see the source code. We've left helpful comments like:
```javascript
// TODO: Make this work
// FIXME: This is broken but I don't know why
// HACK: Don't judge me
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Find a bug** - Shouldn't be hard, they're everywhere
2. **File an issue** - Use our template titled "Everything is broken and I'm sad"
3. **Submit a PR** - We promise to review it within 6-8 business months
4. **Add tests** - Just kidding, we don't have tests

### Code of Conduct

- Be nice to each other
- No fighting in the war room
- Tabs vs Spaces: We use semicolons to avoid this debate entirely
- If you find a working solution, don't tell anyone

## FAQ

**Q: Does this actually work?**
A: Define "work"

**Q: Why did you build this?**
A: It seemed like a good idea at 2 AM

**Q: Can I use this in production?**
A: You can do anything you want! Should you? That's between you and your deployment pipeline.

**Q: Is this project maintained?**
A: As maintained as my sleep schedule (sporadically and with great regret)

**Q: How do I report security vulnerabilities?**
A: Post them on Twitter with our project hashtag for maximum visibility

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make it work
- [ ] Make it work well
- [ ] Add tests (eventually)
- [ ] World domination
- [ ] Fix that weird bug in prod that we're pretending doesn't exist

## Support

If you need help, try these options in order:
1. Read the error message (revolutionary concept)
2. Google it
3. Cry softly
4. File an issue and hope for the best
5. Rewrite everything in Rust
